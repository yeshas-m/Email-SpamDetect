# SpamDetect: Identifying Spam Emails Using C Language


### About

Spam is a significant problem for both email users and email providers. Spam emails can contain malware, scam links, and other potentially dangerous content. They can also squander the time and bandwidth of users. Identifying and blocking spam emails before they reach userâ€™s inboxes is one technique to tackle spam. Spam filters can be used to do this. Spam filters identify spam emails using a variety of techniques, including content analysis, blacklists, and user input.
Spam word counting is one promising spam filtering technique. Spam words are phrases or words that are frequently used in spam emails. Spam filters can develop a more accurate method of identifying spam emails by counting the number of spam words in an email.
This code will create a spam filter by counting spam words. A database of spam and ham emails can be used to train the spam filter. The spam filter can then be used to detect spam emails in a new email database. The purpose of this code is to show the benefits of spam word counting for spam filtering and commonly used spam words.

### Difference Between Two Codes

The main difference between the two codes is that the first code only checks for the presence of spam words in the email, while the second code counts the number of spam words in the email and determines if the email is spam based on the number of spam words.
The first code is simpler and faster, but it is also less accurate. This is because it is possible for a spam email to contain only a few spam words. The second code is more accurate, but it is also slower and more complex. This is because it needs to count the number of spam words in the email and sort the spam words by count.
Any of the following codes can be chosen to detect spam emails. The first code is a simple and fast code that only checks for the spam words in the email, whereas the second code is more accurate that can be used to train a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam.
